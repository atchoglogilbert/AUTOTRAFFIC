# AUTOTRAFFICSIM
Developing a Simulink application that simulates autonomous vehicles navigating through urban traffic scenarios. This project will cover key topics from Simulink Onramp, providing hands-on experience in modeling, simulating, and analyzing complex systems.

** Drag dynamics, why sine wave, cruise control and modelling, signals & systems inc. moving average filter, why 1rad/sec, shortcuts and accessibility
