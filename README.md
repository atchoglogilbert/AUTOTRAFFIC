# AUTOTRAFFICSIM
Developing a Simulink application that simulates autonomous vehicles navigating through urban traffic scenarios. This project will cover key topics from Simulink Onramp, providing hands-on experience in modeling, simulating, and analyzing complex systems.

** Drag dynamics, why sine wave, cruise control and modelling, signals & systems inc. moving average filter, why 1rad/sec, shortcuts and accessibility, relation replication of logical

For example, how would you output any negative values of the sine wave as zero (a half-wave rectifier)? What about outputting any negative values as positive (a full-wave rectifier)?

why always set intial condition in integrator
